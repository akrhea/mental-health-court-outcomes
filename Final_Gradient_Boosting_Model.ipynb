    "Below are the changes we have made to the original notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Reading the data in from a pickle rather than csv. This pickle was first created by Data_Prep.ipynb Jan 28, 2020 during an effort by Kelsey Markey and Alene Rhea to host this project on GitHub. The pickle was re-run April 2, 2020 to account for shifting remove_final_dummy to to Final_Data_Prep.py [note that this change is immaterial in this context.] It's possible that there are inconsistencies between the data read in from csv in the original notebook, and from the data read in via pickle. This question could be investigated, because the original csv still exists in the project Google Drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Not dropping date and location columns, as this step was moved to Data_Prep.ipynb in January 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Using Final_Data_Prep.py for splitting and downsampling. This script was created in January 2020. All functionality is identical, although some print statements have been removed and dead/unreachable code has been deleted. Final_Data_Prep further updated April 2, 2020 to include function to remove final dummy column from each categorical function. (This functionality had been added in Jan 2020 to Data_Prep.ipynb.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Updating comments."
