Abstract: People living with mental illness are especially likely to have encounters with the law; they need dedicated resources and thoughtful treatment as they make their way through the criminal justice system. This project aims to predict mental health-related dispositions and sentences from a set of judicial and case-based features available only at initiation. Early detection of people who are likely to be suffering from mental illnesses will enable governments and other institutions to provide appropriate support to these people as early as possible. The project underscores the need for disparate impact tracking in such systems.

This phase of the project analyzes the automated decision system's data, methodology, and outcomes. The report concludes that the system is not appropriate for deployment.
